ECMAScript 6 represents the biggest change to the core of JavaScript in the history of the language. Not only does the sixth edition add new object types, but also new syntax and exciting new capabilities. The result of years of study and debate, ECMAScript 6 reached feature complete status in 2014. While it will take a bit of time before all JavaScript environments support ECMAScript 6, it's still useful to understand what's coming and which features are available already.

This book is a guide for the transition between ECMAScript 5 and 6. It is not specific to any JavaScript environment, so it is equally useful to web developers as it is Node.js developers.

What you'll learn:

* All of the changes to the language since ECMAScript 5
* How the new class syntax relates to more familiar JavaScript concepts
* Why iterators and generators are useful
* How arrow functions differ from regular functions
* Additional options for storing data using sets, maps, and more
* The power of inheriting from native types
* Why people are so excited about promises for asynchronous programming
* How modules will change the way you organize code
